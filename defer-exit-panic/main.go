// Package atexit implements support for running deferred functions in case of
// abnormal exit (in contrast to a normal exit when the program returns from
// the main function).
//
// Since calling os.Exit, e.g. during a signal handler, does not call deferred
// functions, a complementary mechanism is required when the program acquires
// resources that are not automatically released by the operating system at
// program termination, e.g. SYSV shared memory.
//
// atexit is designed to work with, and complement, Go standard deferred
// mechanism.
// The Exit function provided by this package must be used, in order to run
// registered deferred functions.
//
// The Exit function SHOULD only be called in case of abnormal program
// termination.

// runAtDefer calls the deferred function during standard deferred mechanism.

	d.m.Lock()
	defer d.m.Unlock()

// Do registers the function f to be called in case of abnormal program
// termination, caused by calling the Exit function, and returns a function
// that can be used in a defer statement.
//
// Do SHOULD only be used to release resources that are not automatically
// released by the operating system at program termination.
// The idiomatic use of Do is
//  AcquireResource(...)
//  ...
//  defer atexit.Do(func() {
//      ReleaseResource(...)
//  })()
//
// The function f is called exactly once, either during standard deferred
// mechanism or as part of atexit termination.
//
// If f panics, atexit considers it to have returned; it will not be called again.

// the current program to exit with the given status code.
// In case one of the deferred functions panics, the exit status is ignored and
